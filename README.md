Architecture project and models created with Enterprise Architect.

The file *councilofcoaches.eap* contains the entire Enterprise Architect project.

The *Web* folder contains a browseable HTML export of the project. I recommend using Firefox to open it.

The *Diagram* folder contains image exports of all the diagrams in the project.
